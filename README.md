# Portfolio Evaluation

Here we take a look at four whale portfolios to make a recommendation: Soros Fund Management LLC, Paulson & CO.INC., Tiger Global Management LLC and Berkshire Hathaway INC. We analyze the performance, volatility, risk and the risk-return profile of the portfolios against the S&P 500. This analysis should show which portfolio is both inexpensive and high quality.
